# ChildSafe-Child-Protection-Platform
ChildSafe is a privacy-first, production-ready AI platform designed to detect child users in apps, games, and websites and enforce kid-safe policies. It delivers a Child Likelihood Score (CLS) (0â€“1) and ensures compliance with COPPA, GDPR-K, UK AADC, and India DPDP, all without storing PII or biometrics.

# ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights

Detection Engine: Hybrid rule-based + ML (LightGBM) model with ROC-AUC â‰¥ 0.90 and low latency (<40ms).

FastAPI Backend: Secure endpoints (/v1/detect, /v1/enforce, /v1/telemetry/batch, /v1/feedback, /v1/health, /v1/quota) with OAuth2/JWT authentication.

Policy Enforcement: Rules for geofencing, time-of-day, age bands, violations â†’ actions (allow, lock, PIN challenge, notify guardian).

Content Safety: Modules for grooming, toxicity, NSFW images, risky links, live-chat moderation, screen-time limits, and purchase guardrails.

Privacy & Security: No PII/biometrics, 30-day anonymized logs, HTTPS, RBAC, rate limiting, and audit logs.

SDKs: Web (JavaScript) + Android (Kotlin) for seamless integration into apps and games.

Deployment Ready: Dockerized for Google Cloud Run, Render, Railway, Hugging Face Spaces.
